# Vertical-drag-drop-listview-unity
Implement vertical drag &amp; drop in unity platform.

Recently we were asked to develop a vertical listview with drag and drop feature in one of our key project called TriviaMake™. TriviaMaker is custom quiz maker that available on Android, iOS, and Web. We have searched on Unity documentation for existing component also there isn’t any custom asset available on unity asset store, so we ended up with developing a custom component for the Unity platform.

As per our requirements, User can rearrange quiz categories with drag and drop gesture. We found some solutions but none of them were perfect and were too buggy. The script which we have developed can work with any type of vertical drag.
